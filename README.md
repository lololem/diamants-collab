**DIAMANTS is an open-source platform for the simulation and execution of distributed intelligence. Our philosophy: code once, and deploy everywhere—in simulation and in the real world.**

This project is a 'playground' for developers, creating a robust bridge between high-level intent (the swarm's strategy) and low-level execution (each drone's physical commands). It's a space to code distributed intelligence, test it in a credible simulation, and push it directly to real-world swarms.

## 🎯 Vision

DIAMANTS's objective is to tackle a major technical challenge: achieving emergent collective behaviors in open, modular, and interoperable code. We aim to demonstrate that distributed intelligence is not a theoretical concept, but a robust, documented, and reusable software artifact for the community.

## ✨ Key Features & Technical Challenges

### 🌱 Open Source by Design

Our entire ecosystem is built on recognized open standards. No proprietary lock-in.

**Main Stack:**
- **Backend & Simulation**: ROS 2, Gazebo, PX4/ArduPilot, MAVROS
- **Frontend & Visualization**: Vite, Three.js, Babylon.js, WebGL, Node.js

**Goal**: To foster an ecosystem where every developer can contribute, test, and enrich the platform.

### 🌐 Radical Interoperability

A defined mission must be understood by any agent, regardless of its hardware or middleware.
- **Universal Missions**: Mission definitions in YAML/JSON
- **Unified APIs**: Design of agnostic interfaces and mission translators

### 🧠 From Simple Rules to Collective Intelligence

The scientific core of the project is the study of emergence from simple interactions.
- **Explored Algorithms**: Stigmergy, consensus algorithms, social forces (Lennard-Jones type)
- **Challenge**: To code simple behavioral bricks and observe the emergence of a credible collective intelligence

### 🔄 Seamless Sim-to-Real Workflow

Simulation is a mirror of reality. Zero throwaway code.
- **High-Fidelity Simulation**: The high-level code produces command streams via ROS 2 that are translated identically for the simulator and for physical agents
- **Continuous Validation**: Every line of code is validated in simulation and then executed without any modification on the real hardware
- **Frontend & Visualization**: Vite, Three.js, Babylon.js, WebGL, Node.js

**Goal**: To foster an ecosystem where every developer can contribute, test, and enrich the platform.
